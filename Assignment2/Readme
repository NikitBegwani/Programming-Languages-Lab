These prolog assignments were written using SWI-Prolog.

Assignment2-part1-

a) Logic for successor is to append 1 to input list
b) Logic for plus is to append both the input list and output the result
c) Logic for minus is to remove one element each time from both the input list as soon as one of the list becomes empty.
   we check if its the first or second, assuming the first list to be the bigger one, we print the remaining elements in first list
   if its empty, we print blank list.
d) Logic for multiply is we first find out cartesian product of both the list then , we flatten the list. i.e. join all the list within the list
   after that we tak one half of the flattened list as answer
   Example:- [x,x]X[x,x,x] -- cartesian product :- [[x,x],[x,x],[x,x],[x,x],[x,x],[x,x]] 
   -- flattened list :- [x,x,x,x,x,x,x,x,x,x,x,x]-- Result :- [x,x,x,x,x,x].
e) Logic for divide is, each time we remove elements of length(divisor), if the remainder is 0, we print true else false.

Assignment2-Part 2(a):-

we first establish possible movements and some ground truth rules for direction , then , we traverse the input list and check what is the final orientation and position of pointer following the above mentioned ground truth direction rules and movements.

Assignment2-Part 2(b):-

At each step we compare the destination point with the current location andaccording to the current-orientation, we make the movement by adding +1 or -1 in current_location in y or x direction 

Assignment2-Part3:-

We first create a list of list with each sublist representing a pizza, we follow the steps given in question and code it in prolog language after which we run a permutation and select operation which assigns a unique possibility by keeping in mind the condition specified previously.
